        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sakeenah Camara, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am pursuing a degree in Information Sciences with a concentration in User Experience Design (UXD) and minoring in Applied Artificial Intelligence. I am passionate about technology and creative problem-solving, particularly in enhancing user experiences in the beauty industry.</p>

        <p>I have developed a strong background in customer service through my experiences at Panera Bread, Target, and Chick-fil-A. At Panera Bread, I demonstrated a commitment to excellent service, which led to increased guest satisfaction and a notable improvement in our tip rate. Working in these fast-paced environments taught me how to thrive under pressure, work effectively in teams, and deliver results. My role at Target in the Beauty department allowed me to apply my organizational and interpersonal skills, helping to boost sales and providing personalized recommendations that improved customer experiences.</p>

        <p>In high school, I gained valuable leadership and business management experience through my involvement in Virtual Enterprise. As part of a team, I contributed to developing business proposals and marketing strategies for a simulated virtual business, earning recognition in regional competitions. These experiences have honed my collaboration, decision-making, and strategic thinking skills.</p>

        <p>Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I am an avid creative writer, specializing in poetry and fiction. I also enjoy dancing, which allows me to express my creativity and stay active. My ambition and persistence drive me to set and achieve my goals, particularly in pursuing a career in the beauty industry in tech-related roles such as UX/UI design or product management. Additionally, being fluent in French and having a working knowledge of Spanish enhances my ability to connect with diverse teams and clients.</p>
